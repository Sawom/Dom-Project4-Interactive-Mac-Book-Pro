## Dom-Project4-Interactive-Mac-Book-Pro
This is my Dom js project. Here one customer can customize his/her Mac Pro. <br>
Here base varient starts from $1299. If one customer can add 16GB unified memory, then add $180.But if he satisfied with 8GB unified memory then no money is added. <br>
Similerly, there is no mney added with 256GB SSD storage. But if a customer wants to add 512GB SSD storage $100 is added and if a customer wants to add 1TB SSD storage $180 is added. <br>
Similerly, if a customer wants early shipment then $20 is added and for default option no money is added. <br>
<b> Pomo Code: </b> <br>
Here pomo code 'stevekaku' then 20% cash off. <br> <br>
